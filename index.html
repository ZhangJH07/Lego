    <h1>What developers said about Supercell</h1>

    <div class="testimonial-row">
        <div class="testimonial-col">
            <div class="name">
                <img src="images/person1.jpg">
                <div class="name-info">
                    <h3>Ilkka Paananen</h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Since these early days, we’ve killed countless games at various stages of development. 
                Usually they get killed after a milestone we call a “company playable”, which means that 
                the team releases the game for everyone in the company to play. In addition to Clash, 
                Hay Day and Boom Beach, the only two games that have managed to proceed to beta and launch globally are
                Clash Royale and Brawl Stars. It really never ceases to amaze us how incredibly difficult it is to design new games. 
                You would think it would get easier over time, especially when you’ve been lucky enough to put out hits like we have. 
                But to be totally honest, it isn’t any easier today than it was when we were just getting started.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial-col">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We’d like to think that every failure is a unique opportunity to learn, and every lesson will ultimately 
                make us better at what we do. That’s why we have a tradition of celebrating these lessons by drinking champagne
                every time we screw up. For us, it’s clear that releasing hit games means having to take big risks. And by definition, 
                taking those risks means that you’ll fail more often than you’ll succeed. So whenever we realize that we haven’t failed in a while, 
                it’s a sign that we haven’t taken enough risks. And that is truly the biggest possible risk for a creative company like ours.</p>
        </div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Of course, taking risks isn’t only limited to creating games. We have some very ambitious ideas about how games can be marketed to the 
                global populations of more than a billion gamers on mobile today. We want to find exciting new ways to tell everyone on the planet about our games. 
                At some point we realized that for the first time in the history of gaming it’s now possible to create a truly global games company. 
                A company that not only has hit games in western markets but also in the big eastern markets like Japan, Korea and China. 
                To this end, we’ve opened offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, and we’ve been pleasantly surprised at how warmly our games have been received there.</p>
