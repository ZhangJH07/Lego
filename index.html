    <h1>The story of Supercell</h1>

    <p>In the summer of 2010, Supercell was born. Back then, the founders had no idea what the company would become. 
        They just knew they wanted to make great games that people would play for years. 
        To do so, they would create a new kind of gaming company. In 2021, the dream is bigger than ever.</p>

        <p>Supercell was founded on a few core beliefs.</p>

        <h4>The best teams make the best games</h4>
        
        <p>We used this simple sentence to describe our idea of a new kind of games company that would 
            put people front and center. We thought to ourselves: “What if you put together a games company the way you’d put 
            together a professional sports team?” In that type of model, the sole mission of the founders and 
            management would be to acquire the best talent for every single position, create the best possible 
            environment for them, and then get out of the way. It would be an environment with zero bureaucracy. 
            A place where the best people could make the biggest possible impact and nothing would stand in their way. 
            Everything else, including financial goals, would be secondary. Over the years, 
            we realized that even more important than having the best people is having the best teams – 
            just as in sports, where World Cups and Championships are won by teams, not individuals.</p>
        
        <h4>Small and independent cells</h4>
        
        <p>We’ve found that the best quality work comes from small teams in which every member is passionate 
            about what they do. Oftentimes when teams become bigger, processes, bureaucracy and even politics 
            emerge, and the work just isn’t fun anymore. That’s why we wanted to create an organizational 
            model made up of very small teams, or “cells” as we call them. Supercell is a collection of these cells.
            Each game comes from a cell, and they all operate extremely independently and have complete control 
            over their own roadmap. Our organizational model is optimized for speed and passion, not for control.</p>
        
        <h4>Games that people will play for years</h4>
        
        <p>Many of us had been big fans of games like World of Warcraft, which most people play for years, 
            not just weeks or months. Our dream was to create game services with longevity like that. 
            And we wanted to create them for the widest group of people possible. They would be games 
            that almost everyone could get into. The two core pillars around which we wanted to build 
            this longevity would be game play and social. We believed in the power of simple, fun game play. 
            Many of us even longed for the golden days of PC gaming when games were all about great game play. 
            And when it comes to social, we just thought games would be more fun when played with friends and 
            other people.</p>

    <h1>What developers said about Supercell</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial-row">
        <div class="testimonial-col">
            <div class="name">
                <img src="images/person1.jpg">
                <div class="name-info">
                    <h3>Ilkka Paananen</h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Since these early days, we’ve killed countless games at various stages of development. 
                Usually they get killed after a milestone we call a “company playable”, which means that 
                the team releases the game for everyone in the company to play. In addition to Clash, 
                Hay Day and Boom Beach, the only two games that have managed to proceed to beta and launch globally are
                Clash Royale and Brawl Stars. It really never ceases to amaze us how incredibly difficult it is to design new games. 
                You would think it would get easier over time, especially when you’ve been lucky enough to put out hits like we have. 
                But to be totally honest, it isn’t any easier today than it was when we were just getting started.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial-col">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We’d like to think that every failure is a unique opportunity to learn, and every lesson will ultimately 
                make us better at what we do. That’s why we have a tradition of celebrating these lessons by drinking champagne
                every time we screw up. For us, it’s clear that releasing hit games means having to take big risks. And by definition, 
                taking those risks means that you’ll fail more often than you’ll succeed. So whenever we realize that we haven’t failed in a while, 
                it’s a sign that we haven’t taken enough risks. And that is truly the biggest possible risk for a creative company like ours.</p>
        </div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Of course, taking risks isn’t only limited to creating games. We have some very ambitious ideas about how games can be marketed to the 
                global populations of more than a billion gamers on mobile today. We want to find exciting new ways to tell everyone on the planet about our games. 
                At some point we realized that for the first time in the history of gaming it’s now possible to create a truly global games company. 
                A company that not only has hit games in western markets but also in the big eastern markets like Japan, Korea and China. 
                To this end, we’ve opened offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, and we’ve been pleasantly surprised at how warmly our games have been received there.</p>
